    <h1>About Us</h1>
<p>UC Santa Barbara is popular for having multitudes of Chicano/Latino organizations that support students in their quest towards becoming productive members of society while preserving their cultural heritage. UCSB offered plenty of political, special interest, and career-focus organizations, however, there was a deep void that existed when it came to supporting specifically Chicano/Latino males at the university and in the communities. It was this void that prompted concerned students to come together to create a group that will indiscriminately help Chicano/Latino males reach the university and become successful professionals for their personal advantage and for the strengthening of "el movimiento" as a whole.

During the mid to late nineteen-nineties, there existed a major backlash against Chicano/Latinos in the state of California. In 1996, Proposition 187, the "anti-immigration initiative", targeted Latinos for the major economic and social problems occurring in the state. Two years later, Proposition 209 was introduced and approved which put an end to affirmative action in government supported programs and jobs. These propositions led to a decrease in Chicano/Latino university attendance throughout the state and it severely affected even more so the Chicano/Latino males. From 1996 to 1998, Chicano/Latino male attendance at the University of California has decreased from 43% to 41% of the total Chicano/Latino population. Moreover, Chicano/Latinos make up approximately 9% of the total UC attendance with Chicano/Latino males making up less than 4% of the total. In response to these numbers, Chicano/Latino male students at UC Santa Barbara took action to create an organization that would promote higher graduation and retention rates amongst Chicano/Latino males and create and support outreach programs to encourage Chicano/Latino students to become eligible and attend a university.

Towards the beginning of the Fall 1999 quarter, dialogue through e-mail had begun amongst three men who discussed the possibility of restarting the interest of forming a Chicano/Latino male organization on campus after the disappointing breakdown of a previous movement a year earlier. Students who for the most part did not know one another agreed to meet for the first time on Thursday October 22, 1999. In an unexpected coincidence, it was during this day that universities throughout the state decided to strike and protest against Proposition 209 and the threat of dismantling ethnic studies programs. Many students stormed into Cheadle Hall, the administration building, and hosted a sit-in in the chancellor's office until the chancellor agreed to publicly support ethnic studies and underrepresented students. It was during these protests that some of the interested hombres met for the first time and rather than leaving the sit-in to attend the first meeting, it was decided that the meeting will be held just outside the chancellor's office. It was there, amongst the energy of activism and change, that the same hombres who attended the meeting became the founders of the first Latino male organization at UCSB; Darvin Quintana, Isidro Pineda, Isaac Lopez, Javier Angulo, Jose Cevallos, Juan Aquino, Miguelangel Arellano, Ricky Ortega, and Rolando Flores. 
Now that the formation of a Chicano/Latino male organization was agreed upon, it was decided to begin meeting weekly. The big question then emerged, "Should we create a new group or expand form another well-established group at another campus". It was clear that Chicano/Latino male organizations at universities were few in numbers but one organization met the principles that the founders sought. An organization that promoted balance amongst the individual and that has had an impact in their own community. An organization with flexibility and strength that will continue beyond graduation and that will create a web of support throughout the state. One that accepts all males, regardless of their political beliefs, and is exclusive of indiscriminate induction processes. An organization was sought that will generate HERMANDAD! Hermanos Unidos at Berkeley was the ideal organization for UC Santa Barbara.

The next step was to contact Hermanos Unidos at Berkeley and introduce to them the idea of expanding their organization down south to UC Santa Barbara. Hermanos Unidos at this point was only a local organization and expansion of the organization was new to them and unexpected. There existed communication problems at first but the UCSB founders were determined to reap the benefits that Hermanos Unidos at Berkeley had given to their local population for ten years. Moreover, it was one of their stated goals in their constitution that motivated the founders to keep pursuing this venture:

From the beginning Hermanos Unidos has envisioned other Chicano and Latino organizations as ours throughout the U.C. system and other academic institutions. We will continue to push forward this goal through constant communication and sharing of ideals with other Hermanos chapters". 
After many attempts of communicating with Berkeley, the hombres at UCSB decided to get in contact with an HU alumnus. Alex Bruno, a UCLA Law student, was contacted and a meeting was scheduled at UCLA on November 19, 1998. It was there that details were worked out and specific questions were answered. The excitement of Hermanos Unidos expanding to another campus became evident amongst Alumni and the UCSB founders. After considering the determination and well-organized men at UCSB, it was decided to initiate the process of forming a new Hermanos Unidos. On November 23, 1999, Hermanos Unidos UCSB, as this organization was formerly titled, officially became the first Hermanos Unidos organization outside of Berkeley and the first Chicano/Latino organization at UC Santa Barbara.

In only one year, Hermanos Unidos UCSB has grown to be amongst the largest organizations at UC Santa Barbara. The founders' insistence and dedication to serving the Chicano/Latino population became a reality. The future will depend on the determinations of other Chicano/Latino males who believe in the same principles that the previous hermanos had followed before them: the advancement and self-determination of raza through education. En la union existe la fuerza.
